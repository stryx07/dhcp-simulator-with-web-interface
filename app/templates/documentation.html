    <h2>DHCP Protocol Basics</h2>
    <p>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to assign IP addresses and network configuration to devices
        automatically. The process typically follows the DORA exchange:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>D</strong>iscover: Client broadcasts looking for a server.</li>
        <li><strong>O</strong>ffer: Server offers an IP address.</li>
        <li><strong>R</strong>equest: Client requests the offered IP.</li>
        <li><strong>A</strong>ck: Server acknowledges and reserves the IP.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Attack Scenarios</h2>

    <h3>1. DHCP Starvation (Saturation)</h3>
    <p>An attacker floods the DHCP server with DISCOVER packets using spoofed MAC addresses. This exhausts the server's
        IP address pool, preventing legitimate clients from connecting to the network.</p>

    <h3>2. IP Conflict</h3>
    <p>An attacker statically assigns themselves an IP that is already in use or currently being offered by the DHCP
        server, causing network instability for the legitimate owner of that IP.</p>

    <h3>3. DHCP Spoofing (Rogue Server)</h3>
    <p>An attacker sets up a rogue DHCP server to answer DISCOVER requests faster than the legitimate server, assigning
        clients malicious DNS servers or gateways (Man-in-the-Middle).</p>
